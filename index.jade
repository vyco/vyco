            h1 we are transparent 
            p  We, at <strong> vyco</strong> have found that clients of web developers have a 50/50 chance of being satsfied with their end product. As at times the client will not see the finished project until it is uploaded. At vyco, once we are given a project we will upload the site immediatley, however, this will be on a private server, therefore, only us and client will be able to see the site live as changes are made.
